1. Please find the link :- https://65182b6581b82d2d8d974638--incredible-bunny-2af654.netlify.app/
2. Pleas avoid the links if it is not working . I will add all the links of my github and resume very soon. As how much time it will take to put the link in  href = ""  of <a> anchor tag.
3. I haven't added because eventually I haven't deployed the app from github rather direct the uploading the build folder in netlify, that will make me to again upload and you know it is not easy to deploy always.
